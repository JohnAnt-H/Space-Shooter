# Space-Shooter
Video Game For Software Engineering


ALRIGHTY! ALL IMPORTANT INFO FOR THE CONTRIBUTORS IS HERE

THIS PROJECT CODE IS MOST LIKELY GOING TO BE 1000000% GD SCRIPT
also...
We are going to use a different method for function returns and stuff!!
Instead of traditional Node scripts and building the code from the ground up, we are going to be using COMPONENTS (found in the main resources folder) 
The components are lines of codes (functions & signals), primarily that we can link to the sprites of our creation to help them undergo certain actions 
FOR INSTANCE, I can use a handy-dandy "move_component" to help with the movement of literally EVERYTHING that moves within the game instead of setting up hot keys and directional patterns that get repetitive and can be messy .:)
